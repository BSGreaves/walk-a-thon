# Walk-a-thon Exercise

For this exercise, I created a Walk-a-thon donation page. Users can use the form on the right to make a pledge. When they click the "Pledge!" button, their information is stored and then added to the table on the left. I designed the page using BootStrap to keep it responsive and clean.

## Usage

To become a donor, fill in your information on the right hand side of the page. Click "Pledge!" to add your name to the table of donors on the left.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/BSGreaves/walkathon.git
cd walkathon
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at:
`http://localhost:8080`
